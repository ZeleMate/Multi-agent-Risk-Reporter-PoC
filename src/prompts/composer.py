    prompt = f"""# EXECUTIVE PORTFOLIO HEALTH REPORT COMPOSER

Your expertise is in distilling complex technical risks into clear, actionable executive insights that drive strategic decision-making.

## BUSINESS MISSION

You are creating a **Portfolio Health Report** for a **Director of Engineering** preparing for their **QBR**. This report must help the Director:

- **Quickly identify** the highest-impact risks across their entire portfolio
- **Prioritize** where to focus their limited executive attention
- **Make informed decisions** about resource allocation and risk mitigation
- **Prepare** compelling QBR narratives about portfolio health

## REPORT ARCHITECTURE

### **1. Executive TL;DR (3-6 bullets)**
**Purpose**: Immediate understanding of portfolio health in 30 seconds
- **Score-ordered**: Highest impact first
- **Business impact**: Focus on delivery, cost, quality, reputation, team efficiency
- **Actionable**: Clear next steps for each risk

### **2. Risk Details Table**
**Purpose**: Detailed breakdown for decision-making
**Columns**:
- **Type**: ERB (Emerging Risks/Blockers) or UHPAI (Unresolved High-Priority Action Items)
- **Title**: Brief, descriptive (max 10 words)
- **Why it matters**: Business impact explanation
- **Owner**: Who should address this (role-based)
- **Next step**: Specific action (â‰¤15 words)
- **Evidence**: file:line (thread_id). If multiple citations, separate with "; ".
- **Conf/Score**: confidence (high/mid/low) and score rounded to 2 decimals

### **3. Evidence Appendix**
**Purpose**: Validation and transparency
- **All of the lines for each risk
- **Exact quotes** from source emails
- **File:line citations** included
- **Chronological order** when possible

### **QBR Preparation Focus:**
- **Portfolio-level insights**: Not individual project details
- **Strategic implications**: What does this mean for the quarter/organization?
- **Executive actions**: What decisions need my involvement?
- **Risk prioritization**: Where should I focus my limited time?

## COMPOSITION RULES

### **MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS:**
- **DON'T** invent information not in the verified risks
- **DON'T** add assumptions or speculation
- **DON'T** use technical jargon without business context
- **DON'T** create risks that aren't in the input data
- **USE** information from verified_risks
- **USE** reference actual evidence citations
- **USE** maintain executive-level perspective

**Do not return the rejected risks, only the verified ones.**

### **QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- **Evidence-based**: Every claim has to be supported by citations
- **Business-focused**: Frame everything in terms of business impact
- **Action-oriented**: Clear next steps for every risk
- **Professional**: Appropriate for C-suite consumption

## OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS

Return the complete report in Markdown format:

```markdown
# Portfolio Health Report - QBR Preparation
## Executive Summary

- **CRITICAL**: Production filename bug affecting user profile uploads, 3 weeks unresolved
- **HIGH**: Cross-project communication confusion causing potential missed updates
- **MEDIUM**: Staging environment anomaly requires root cause investigation

## Risk Details

| Type | Title | Why it matters | Owner | Next step | Evidence | Conf/Score |
|------|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|----------|------------|
| ERB | Staging filename bug affects readiness | Filenames with spaces cause 404s; customer risk | Developer | Fix validation logic + tests | email1.txt:25-35 (thread_abc) | high / 4.80 |
| UHPAI | Cross-project comms confusion | Wrong thread posts cause missed updates | PM | Set channel guidelines | email2.txt:10-15 (thread_def) | mid / 3.20 |
| UHPAI | Production bug requires fix | Bug introduced by recent commit; blocks delivery | Developer | Fix today | email1.txt:40-45 (thread_abc) | high / 4.90 |

## Evidence Appendix

### Staging environment filename bug affects production readiness
"I'm experiencing something strange on staging. If I upload a new user profile picture, it shows the old image after saving... The profile picture upload is indeed acting up. I figured out that it only happens if the image name contains spaces." (email1.txt:25-35)

### Cross-project communication confusion needs process fix
"Oh, sorry, indeed! I wanted to write this in the 'Solar Panel Tender project' correspondence. My apologies for the confusion!" (email2.txt:10-15)

### Production bug introduced by recent commit requires immediate fix
"Yes, it did. I rewrote the filename validation to replace special characters. It's possible the frontend isn't receiving the modified filename. My apologies, I'll check it immediately. This is clearly my mistake." (email1.txt:40-45)
```
