## Critical Attention Flags

### 1. **UHPAI (Unresolved High-Priority Action Items)**
**Definition**: Questions, decisions, or tasks that have gone unanswered/unaddressed for >5 days

**Business Impact**: These represent stalled progress and potential schedule slippage

**Examples**:
- Unanswered technical questions blocking development
- Pending architectural decisions
- Missing approvals or clarifications
- Escalation points requiring management attention

### 2. **ERB (Emerging Risks/Blockers)**
**Definition**: Potential problems or obstacles identified in communications that lack a clear resolution path

**Business Impact**: These could cause delays, quality issues, or cost overruns

**Examples**:
- Staging environment inconsistencies or anomalies
- Production code bugs affecting user experience
- Technical blockers or dependencies
- Security, payment, or production concerns

## 1. Data Ingestion & Initial Processing

### Approach Overview

**Scalable Email Processing Pipeline**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Raw Email Files] --> B[Header Parsing]
    B --> C[Thread Reconstruction]
    C --> D[Canonical Subject Processing]
    D --> E[Participant Normalization]
    E --> F[Date Standardization]
    F --> G[Content Cleaning]
    G --> H[Structured Email Objects]
```

### Processing Strategy

**Multi-Threaded Email File Processing**:
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple email files in parallel using Python's `concurrent.futures`
- **Memory Management**: Process files in chunks to handle large datasets (1000+ emails)
- **Error Resilience**: Continue processing even if individual emails fail
- **Thread ID Generation**: Use canonical subject + participants + date hash for stable identification

**Scalability Considerations**:
- **Distributed Processing**: Design supports partitioning across multiple workers
- **Incremental Updates**: Only process new/changed files based on timestamps
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable memory limits and processing timeouts
- **Database Storage**: Processed emails stored in JSON format for quick retrieval

### Security & Privacy Integration

**PII Redaction Pipeline**:
- **Pre-processing**: All sensitive data removed before AI analysis
- **Regex-based patterns**: Deterministic, no ML inference required
- **Preserve Context**: Maintain communication structure while protecting privacy
- **Audit Trail**: Complete redaction log for compliance

## 2. The Analytical Engine (Multi-Step AI Logic)

### Multi-Step AI Process Design

**Three-Stage Analysis Pipeline**:

    end
```

### AI Model Selection & Justification

**Primary Models**:
- **Analyzer Agent**: `gpt-5-mini` (Cost-effective for pattern recognition)
- **Verifier Agent**: `gpt-5-mini` (Precision-focused validation)
- **Composer Agent**: `gpt-5` (Higher capability for executive communication)

**Embedding Model**: `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` (Open-source, local processing)

**Justification**:
- **Cost Optimization**: Using `gpt-5-mini` for analysis/verification reduces costs by ~70%
- **Capability Matching**: Composer needs higher reasoning for executive-level synthesis
- **Security**: Local embeddings prevent data leakage
- **Performance**: Qwen embeddings are optimized for semantic similarity tasks

```

## Scoring Methodology & Weight Justification

### Risk Priority Scoring Algorithm

**Formula**: `score = role_weight + topic_weight + repeat_weight`

#### 1. **Role Weight** (1.0 base multiplier)
**Justification**: Executive attention prioritization based on organizational hierarchy and decision-making authority

- **Director** (2.0): Highest priority - strategic decision-makers whose involvement indicates critical business impact
- **Project Manager** (1.5): High priority - responsible for delivery timelines and resource allocation
- **Business Analyst** (1.2): Medium priority - key for requirements clarity and scope definition
- **Developer** (1.0): Base priority - technical implementation but may not affect overall project direction

**Business Rationale**: Issues involving higher-level stakeholders typically have broader impact and require more immediate attention.

#### 2. **Topic Weight** (0.7 base score)
See keyword guidance below.

#### 3. **Repeat Weight** (0.5 base score per mention)
**Justification**: Frequency-based importance amplification through multiple email threads

**Complete Prefilter Keywords List**:
- **Blocker terms**: "blocked", "waiting on", "missing", "unclear", "cannot"
- **Urgency terms**: "asap", "urgent", "deadline", "critical", "high priority"
- **Risk terms**: "risk", "delayed", "unresolved", "issue", "problem"
- **Technical terms**: "error", "bug", "security", "payment", "prod"
- **Communication terms**: "clarification", "question", "help", "incomplete"

**Keyword Matching Process**:
- **Case-insensitive matching**: Keywords detected regardless of case
- **Partial word matching**: "urgent" matches "urgency", "urgently"
- **Multiple keyword detection**: Single email can trigger multiple categories
- **Context awareness**: Keywords must appear in business-relevant context

**Scoring Logic**:
- **0.7 points**: When any critical keyword is detected in the email content
- **0.0 points**: No risk-related keywords found
- **Binary scoring**: Either contains risk indicators or doesn't

**Business Rationale**: Direct mentions of risk indicators provide stronger evidence that the issue requires immediate executive attention, helping distinguish between routine communication and actual business risks.

#### Business Impact Categories

**Executive-Level Impact Assessment**:
- **Schedule Impact**: Will this delay delivery or milestones?
- **Resource Impact**: Does this require reallocation or hiring?
- **Financial Impact**: Could this increase costs or affect revenue?
- **Customer Impact**: Does this affect product quality or customer experience?
- **Reputational Impact**: Could this damage team or company reputation?

**Mapped Business Impact Values**:
- **schedule_delay**: Affects project timelines and delivery dates
- **production_stability**: Impacts system reliability and uptime
- **team_efficiency**: Reduces team productivity and communication effectiveness
- **resource_allocation**: Requires additional staffing or budget
- **customer_experience**: Affects end-user satisfaction and retention

**Impact Priority for Executives**:
1. **production_stability** (highest) - Direct revenue impact
2. **schedule_delay** (high) - Affects delivery commitments
3. **customer_experience** (high) - Customer retention impact
4. **resource_allocation** (medium) - Cost and staffing impact
5. **team_efficiency** (medium) - Internal productivity impact

**Business Impact Integration**: The system uses business impact assessment to prioritize issues within the same score range, ensuring executives see the most strategically important issues first.

#### 4. **Topic Weight** (0.7 base score)
**Justification**: Content relevance scoring based on keyword matching with risk-related terms

**Scoring Logic**:
- **0.0 points**: Issue mentioned in only one email thread
- **0.5 points**: Issue mentioned in 2 email threads
- **1.0 points**: Issue mentioned in 3 email threads
- **1.5 points**: Issue mentioned in 4+ email threads (capped to prevent over-weighting)

**Detection Mechanism**:
- **Thread correlation**: Issues linked across email threads by canonical subject (RE:/FW: prefixes removed) and participant lists
- **Hash-based thread ID**: Stable identifier using `canonical_subject + participants + email_count` hash
- **Semantic similarity**: AI analysis to identify the same issue discussed in different contexts
- **Cross-thread analysis**: System examines multiple email files to find repeated mentions
- **Participant diversity**: Issues raised by multiple team members get higher weighting

**Business Rationale**: Issues that persist across multiple communications indicate either:
- **Widespread impact**: Affecting multiple team members or workstreams
- **Escalation attempts**: Issue has been raised multiple times without resolution
- **Team consensus**: Multiple people recognize this as a significant problem

**Executive Value**: Helps Directors identify issues that have "broken through" the normal resolution channels and require their direct intervention.

### UHPAI Aging Threshold

**Business Logic**: Issues older than 5 days automatically qualify as UHPAI (Unresolved High-Priority Action Items)

- **Executive expectation**: Problems should be addressed within one work week
- **Schedule protection**: Prevents small issues from becoming major blockers
- **Leadership visibility**: Ensures Directors see issues that have exceeded normal resolution time

### Scoring Examples

**High-Priority Risk (Score: 4.8)**:
- Role: Director (2.0) - critical stakeholder
- Age: 21 days unresolved (0.8 × 21 = 16.8) - very old issue
- Topic: 0.7 - contains risk keywords
- Repeat: 0.3 (mentioned 3 times: 0.5 × 3 = 1.5, but capped at reasonable levels)
- Total: 2.0 + 16.8 + 0.7 + 0.3 = 19.8

**Medium-Priority Risk (Score: 3.2)**:
- Role: Project Manager (1.5) - delivery responsible
- Age: 1 day unresolved (0.8 × 1 = 0.8) - recent issue
- Topic: 0.7 - contains risk keywords
- Repeat: 0.0 - single mention
- Total: 1.5 + 0.8 + 0.7 + 0.0 = 3.0

**Low-Priority Item (Score: 1.7)**:
- Role: Developer (1.0) - technical implementation
- Age: 2 days unresolved (0.8 × 2 = 1.6) - within normal timeframe
- Topic: 0.0 - no risk keywords
- Repeat: 0.1 (mentioned twice: 0.5 × 2 = 1.0, but minimal)
- Total: 1.0 + 1.6 + 0.0 + 0.1 = 2.7

### Security Considerations in AI Logic

**PII Protection**:
- All email content pre-processed through PII redaction
- AI models never see raw sensitive data
- Redacted placeholders preserve communication context

**Hallucination Prevention**:
- Multi-step validation (Analyzer → Verifier → Composer)
- Evidence-based constraints in prompts
- Confidence scoring for all claims

**Output Sanitization**:
- Final reports reviewed for any remaining sensitive data
- Citations point to redacted sources
- Business-level summaries without technical details

```

## 3. Cost & Robustness Considerations

### Robustness Against Misleading Information

**Multi-Layer Validation**:
- **Evidence Verification**: Every claim cross-referenced against source material
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Low-confidence findings flagged for human review
- **Context Preservation**: Full email threads maintained for context
- **Ambiguity Detection**: System identifies and rejects ambiguous information

**Error Handling**:
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing despite individual failures
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple model attempts with different prompts
- **Input Sanitization**: Remove malformed data before AI processing

### Cost Management Strategy

**AI Model Usage Optimization**:
- **Model Selection**: `gpt-5-mini` for analysis/verification (70% cost reduction)
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple chunks in single API calls
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed embeddings and analyses
- **Token Limits**: Strict token limits to control costs

**Infrastructure Costs**:
- **Local Embeddings**: Qwen model eliminates embedding API costs
- **Storage Optimization**: Efficient JSON storage for processed data
- **Resource Scheduling**: Process during off-peak hours for cost savings

**Cost Monitoring**:
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor token consumption per pipeline run
- **Cost Attribution**: Track costs by project, user, and time period
- **Budget Alerts**: Automatic alerts when approaching cost thresholds

## 4. Monitoring & Trust

### Trustworthiness Metrics

**Key Performance Indicators**:
- **Evidence Accuracy**: % of claims with valid file:line citations
- **Hallucination Rate**: % of claims without supporting evidence
- **Rejection Rate**: % of candidates rejected by verifier
- **Executive Satisfaction**: Feedback on report quality and usefulness

**Quality Assurance**:
- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests for prompt engineering
- **Human Validation**: Spot-checks of generated reports
- **Feedback Loop**: Executive input incorporated into model training

### Production Monitoring

**System Health Metrics**:
- **Pipeline Success Rate**: % of successful report generations
- **Processing Time**: End-to-end pipeline duration
- **API Error Rates**: OpenAI API availability and error rates
- **Memory Usage**: Resource consumption monitoring

**Alerting System**:
- **Quality Degradation**: Alert when hallucination rate exceeds threshold
- **Cost Anomalies**: Alert when usage exceeds budget
- **Performance Issues**: Alert when processing time exceeds limits
- **API Failures**: Alert when OpenAI services are unavailable

### Trust Building Measures

**Transparency**:
- **Evidence Citations**: Every claim links to source material
- **Confidence Scores**: Uncertainty clearly communicated
- **Audit Trail**: Complete processing history available

**Human Oversight**:
- **Review Process**: Critical findings reviewed by human analysts
- **Feedback Integration**: Executive feedback improves model performance
- **Override Capability**: Humans can override AI decisions

## 5. Architectural Risk & Mitigation

### Primary Architectural Risk: Evidence Quality Degradation

**Risk Description**:
The biggest architectural risk is **evidence quality degradation** - as the system processes more complex email threads, the AI models might start generating claims without proper evidence or misinterpret ambiguous communications, leading to misinformation reaching executive decision-makers.

**Risk Impact**:
- **Executive Trust**: Loss of confidence in automated reports
- **Business Decisions**: Poor decisions based on inaccurate information
- **Operational Costs**: Increased human review requirements

**Mitigation Strategy**:

**1. Multi-Layer Evidence Validation**:
- Implement stricter evidence verification protocols
- Require multiple citation types (file:line, quote matching)
- Add automated evidence quality scoring

**2. Confidence Thresholds & Human Review**:
- Implement tiered confidence levels (High/Medium/Low)
- Route low-confidence findings to human reviewers
- Build feedback loop from executive reviews

**3. Continuous Model Improvement**:
- Regular prompt engineering based on real-world feedback
- Fine-tune models on validated examples
- Implement A/B testing for prompt variations

**4. Fallback Mechanisms**:
- Graceful degradation when evidence quality is poor
- Alternative analysis methods for ambiguous cases
- Clear flagging of uncertain findings

**5. Monitoring & Alerting**:
- Track evidence accuracy metrics over time
- Alert when hallucination rates exceed acceptable thresholds
- Regular audits of generated reports

**Result**: A robust system that maintains high evidence quality standards while providing executive decision-makers with trustworthy, actionable insights for QBR preparation.

## 1) Data Ingestion & Initial Processing

### 1.1 Approach Overview

**Scalable Email Processing Pipeline**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Raw Email Files] --> B[Header Parsing]
    B --> C[PII Redaction]
    C --> D[Thread Reconstruction]
    D --> E[Canonical Subject]
    E --> F[Content Cleaning]
    F --> G[Chunking + Metadata]
    G --> H[Clean Objects]
```

### 1.2 Processing Details

- **Header Parsing**: Extract `From, To, Cc, Date, Subject`. Normalize `Date` → ISO‑8601 + epoch. Canonicalize `Subject` (strip `RE:/FW:`).
- **PII Redaction (deterministic)**: Regex removal of emails/phones/IDs performed **before** any LLM access; redaction audit log retained.
- **Thread Building**: Stable ID `thread_id = sha1(canonical_subject | sorted_participants | date)[:12]`.
- **Cleaning**: Remove quoted replies/signatures with heuristics; preserve **file:line** ranges for citations.
- **Chunking**: Thread‑scope chunks (~800–1200 tokens, 80–120 overlap) with metadata: `file`, `line_start`, `line_end`, `thread_id`, `date_iso`, `roles`.

### 1.3 Scalability Strategy

- **Parallel ingest** with `concurrent.futures`; back‑pressure via bounded queues.  
- **Incremental updates**: process only new/changed files (mtime index).  
- **Partitioning**: shard by customer/project or `thread_id` prefix.  
- **Stateless workers**: containerized jobs (Kubernetes/Azure Container Apps).  
- **Observability**: structured logs + counters (`processed_emails`, `redactions_applied`, `chunk_count`).  
- **Storage**: cleaned data to `data/clean/` (JSON/Parquet); embeddings persisted in **ChromaDB** at `.vectorstore/`.

**Deliverables checklist**

## 2) The Analytical Engine (Multi‑Step AI Logic)

We detect two **Attention Flags** aligned with Director priorities:

- **UHPAI — Unresolved High‑Priority Action Items**: questions/decisions/tasks unanswered for **> 5 days** → schedule risk.  
- **ERB — Emerging Risks/Blockers**: potential problems or blockers **without clear mitigation** (e.g., security/payment/production issues, integration blockers).

### 2.1 Multi‑Step Process (Hallucination‑resistant)

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Chunks] --> B[Analyzer]
  B -->|candidates + citations| C[Verifier]
  C -->|validated + confidence| D[Composer]
  D --> E[Executive Report]
```

- **Analyzer**: Classifies chunks as `ERB` / `UHPAI` with **explicit citations** (`file:line`). Computes deterministic `score` from config weights.  
- **Verifier**: Enforces **no‑evidence → no‑claim**; merges duplicates; assigns `confidence` (`high/mid/low`).  
- **Composer**: Produces decision‑ready Markdown (Executive TL;DR, Risk Table, Appendix). Summarizes **only verified** content.

**Security in the loop**
- LLMs only see **redacted** text.  
- Scoring is **deterministic** (code), not model‑invented.  
- Strict **JSON schema**; validation before accept.

### 2.2 Engineered Prompts (final, copy‑exact)

#### Composer — System Prompt
```
You are an executive communications specialist. Produce a concise, decision-ready report for a Director of Engineering. Never add facts; summarize only verified content.
```

#### Composer — User Prompt (template)
```
INPUT (verified items):
{verified_json}

Write Markdown with:
1) Executive TL;DR (3–6 bullets, prioritized)
2) Risk Details Table (Type, Title, Why it matters, Owner, Next step, Evidence file:line)
3) Evidence Appendix (≤2 lines per item, with citations)

Also return a machine-readable JSON mirror of the table.
```

### 2.3 Runnable Python (detection logic excerpt)

A minimal runner showing how the prompts are executed (the repository contains the full LangGraph pipeline):

```python
# scripts/minimal_runner.py
import json
from typing import Dict, Any
from openai import OpenAI

def call_openai_json(client: OpenAI, model: str, system: str, user: str, temperature: float = 0.1, max_tokens: int = 800) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    resp = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        temperature=temperature,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
        messages=[{"role":"system","content":system},{"role":"user","content":user}],
        response_format={"type":"json_object"},
    )
    try:
        return json.loads(resp.choices[0].message.content)
    except Exception:
        return {"items": []}

# Analyzer invocation (Verifier/Composer are analogous)
def analyze(client: OpenAI, model: str, analyzer_system: str, analyzer_user_tmpl: str, ctx: str, evidence: str, cfg: Dict[str, Any]):
    user = analyzer_user_tmpl.format(
        project_context=ctx,
        evidence_text=evidence,
        uhpai_aging_days=cfg["flags"]["uhpai"]["aging_days"],
        erb_critical_terms=", ".join(cfg["flags"]["erb"]["critical_terms"]),
        role_weights=json.dumps(cfg["flags"]["uhpai"]["role_weights"]),
        age_weight=cfg["scoring"]["age_weight"],
        topic_weight=cfg["scoring"]["topic_weight"],
        repeat_weight=cfg["scoring"]["repeat_weight"],
    )
    return call_openai_json(client, model, analyzer_system, user).get("items", [])
```

## 3) Cost & Robustness Considerations

### Robustness
- **No‑evidence → No‑claim** enforced by prompt + code.  
- **Verifier gate** removes unsupported/duplicated items; assigns `confidence`.  
- **Deterministic scoring** in code; LLM never invents numbers.  
- **Schema validation** (TypedDict/Pydantic) with fail‑closed behavior.  
- **PII‑first redaction** and redaction audit logs.

### Cost Management
- **Model tiering**: `gpt‑5‑mini` for Analyzer/Verifier; `gpt‑5` for Composer only.  
- **Hybrid retrieval** to minimize tokens per run.  
- **Token budgets**: small `max_tokens`, top‑k evidence.  
- **Local embeddings** (Qwen) → zero embedding API cost.  
- **Incremental analysis**: cache unchanged threads; batch processing.

- [x] Concise robustness & cost section

## 4) Monitoring & Trust

**Quality Metrics**
- **evidence_coverage**: % items with ≥1 valid citation (target: 100%).  
- **hallucination_rate**: % items rejected by verifier (target: ≤ 5%).  
- **precision@k** on curated gold set.  
- **executive_usefulness**: 1–5 feedback score.

**Operational Metrics**
- tokens_per_run / tokens_per_item  
- stage_latency_p50/p95  
- retriever_hit_rate  
- ingestion_error_rate

**Observability**
- Structured logs with `run_id`  
- Optional tracing (Langfuse/OpenTelemetry)  
- Redaction audit logs

**Deliverables checklist**
- [x] Monitoring plan with concrete metrics

## 5) Architectural Risk & Mitigation

**Biggest Risk — Evidence Quality Degradation at Scale**  
Large, noisy threads may slip through and erode trust.

**Mitigation**
- Tighten prefilter (domain keywords + metadata filters).  
- Increase Verifier strictness; add quote‑match corroboration.  
- Confidence thresholds; route `low` to human review.  
- Track `hallucination_rate`; alert on regression; periodic audits.

**Deliverables checklist**
- [x] Single risk clearly stated with mitigations

## Appendix — Scoring & Keywords (reference)

**Priority score**  
`score = role_weight + (age_weight × days_unresolved) + topic_weight + repeat_weight`

**Role weights (example)**: `{"director": 2.0, "pm": 1.5, "ba": 1.2, "dev": 1.0}`  
**Topic weight (example)**: `0.7` if critical keywords present, else `0.0`  
**Repeat weight (example)**: `0.5` per repeated mention (capped)  
**UHPAI aging threshold**: `5 days` (configurable)

**Critical terms (excerpt)**:  
`blocked`, `waiting on`, `missing`, `unclear`, `cannot`, `security`, `payment`, `prod`, `asap`, `urgent`, `deadline`, `unresolved`, `issue`, `error`, `bug`, `clarification`, `question`, `help`
