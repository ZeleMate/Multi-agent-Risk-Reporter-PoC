## Critical Attention Flags

### 1. **UHPAI (Unresolved High-Priority Action Items)**
**Definition**: Questions, decisions, or tasks that have gone unanswered/unaddressed for >5 days

**Business Impact**: These represent stalled progress and potential schedule slippage

**Examples**:
- Unanswered technical questions blocking development
- Pending architectural decisions
- Missing approvals or clarifications
- Escalation points requiring management attention

### 2. **ERB (Emerging Risks/Blockers)**
**Definition**: Potential problems or obstacles identified in communications that lack a clear resolution path

**Business Impact**: These could cause delays, quality issues, or cost overruns

**Examples**:
- Staging environment inconsistencies or anomalies
- Production code bugs affecting user experience
- Technical blockers or dependencies
- Security, payment, or production concerns

## 1. Data Ingestion & Initial Processing

### Approach Overview

**Scalable Email Processing Pipeline**:

    A[Raw Email Files] --> B[Header Parsing]
    B --> C[Thread Reconstruction]
    C --> D[Canonical Subject Processing]
    D --> E[Participant Normalization]
    E --> F[Date Standardization]
    F --> G[Content Cleaning]
    G --> H[Structured Email Objects]
```

### Processing Strategy

**Multi-Threaded Email File Processing**:
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple email files in parallel using Python's `concurrent.futures`
- **Memory Management**: Process files in chunks to handle large datasets (1000+ emails)
- **Error Resilience**: Continue processing even if individual emails fail
- **Thread ID Generation**: Use canonical subject + participants + date hash for stable identification

**Scalability Considerations**:
- **Distributed Processing**: Design supports partitioning across multiple workers
- **Incremental Updates**: Only process new/changed files based on timestamps
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable memory limits and processing timeouts
- **Database Storage**: Processed emails stored in JSON format for quick retrieval

### Security & Privacy Integration

**PII Redaction Pipeline**:
- **Pre-processing**: All sensitive data removed before AI analysis
- **Regex-based patterns**: Deterministic, no ML inference required
- **Preserve Context**: Maintain communication structure while protecting privacy
- **Audit Trail**: Complete redaction log for compliance

```

## Scoring Methodology & Weight Justification

### Risk Priority Scoring Algorithm

**Formula**: `score = role_weight + (age_weight × days_unresolved) + topic_weight + repeat_weight`

#### 1. **Role Weight** (1.0 base multiplier)
**Justification**: Executive attention prioritization based on organizational hierarchy and decision-making authority

- **Director** (2.0): Highest priority - strategic decision-makers whose involvement indicates critical business impact
- **Project Manager** (1.5): High priority - responsible for delivery timelines and resource allocation
- **Business Analyst** (1.2): Medium priority - key for requirements clarity and scope definition
- **Developer** (1.0): Base priority - technical implementation but may not affect overall project direction

**Business Rationale**: Issues involving higher-level stakeholders typically have broader impact and require more immediate attention.

#### 2. **Age Weight** (0.8 multiplier × days_unresolved)
**Justification**: Time-based urgency escalation for unresolved issues

**Age Calculation**:
- **Current date**: System processes email with current timestamp
- **Issue date**: Timestamp of the email containing the issue
- **Days unresolved**: `(current_date - issue_date).days`
- **UHPAI threshold**: Issues > 5 days automatically flagged as high-priority

**Linear Escalation**:
- **Day 1-5**: Normal resolution timeframe (no age penalty)
- **Day 6+**: Each day adds 0.8 points to the score
- **Executive concern**: Issues > 30 days get maximum age weighting
- **Schedule impact**: Unresolved items increasingly likely to affect delivery milestones

**Business Rationale**: The longer an issue remains unresolved, the greater the risk to project delivery and the more likely it is to cascade into multiple dependent tasks, requiring executive intervention.

#### 3. **Topic Weight** (0.7 base score)
**Justification**: Content relevance scoring based on keyword matching with risk-related terms

**Complete Prefilter Keywords List**:
- **Blocker terms**: "blocked", "waiting on", "missing", "unclear", "cannot"
- **Urgency terms**: "asap", "urgent", "deadline", "critical", "high priority"
- **Risk terms**: "risk", "delayed", "unresolved", "issue", "problem"
- **Technical terms**: "error", "bug", "security", "payment", "prod"
- **Communication terms**: "clarification", "question", "help", "incomplete"

**Keyword Matching Process**:
- **Case-insensitive matching**: Keywords detected regardless of case
- **Partial word matching**: "urgent" matches "urgency", "urgently"
- **Multiple keyword detection**: Single email can trigger multiple categories
- **Context awareness**: Keywords must appear in business-relevant context

**Scoring Logic**:
- **0.7 points**: When any critical keyword is detected in the email content
- **0.0 points**: No risk-related keywords found
- **Binary scoring**: Either contains risk indicators or doesn't

**Business Rationale**: Direct mentions of risk indicators provide stronger evidence that the issue requires immediate executive attention, helping distinguish between routine communication and actual business risks.

#### Business Impact Categories

**Executive-Level Impact Assessment**:
- **Schedule Impact**: Will this delay delivery or milestones?
- **Resource Impact**: Does this require reallocation or hiring?
- **Financial Impact**: Could this increase costs or affect revenue?
- **Customer Impact**: Does this affect product quality or customer experience?
- **Reputational Impact**: Could this damage team or company reputation?

**Mapped Business Impact Values**:
- **schedule_delay**: Affects project timelines and delivery dates
- **production_stability**: Impacts system reliability and uptime
- **team_efficiency**: Reduces team productivity and communication effectiveness
- **resource_allocation**: Requires additional staffing or budget
- **customer_experience**: Affects end-user satisfaction and retention

**Impact Priority for Executives**:
1. **production_stability** (highest) - Direct revenue impact
2. **schedule_delay** (high) - Affects delivery commitments
3. **customer_experience** (high) - Customer retention impact
4. **resource_allocation** (medium) - Cost and staffing impact
5. **team_efficiency** (medium) - Internal productivity impact

**Business Impact Integration**: The system uses business impact assessment to prioritize issues within the same score range, ensuring executives see the most strategically important issues first.

#### 4. **Repeat Weight** (0.5 base score per mention)
**Justification**: Frequency-based importance amplification through multiple email threads

**Scoring Logic**:
- **0.0 points**: Issue mentioned in only one email thread
- **0.5 points**: Issue mentioned in 2 email threads
- **1.0 points**: Issue mentioned in 3 email threads
- **1.5 points**: Issue mentioned in 4+ email threads (capped to prevent over-weighting)

**Detection Mechanism**:
- **Thread correlation**: Issues linked across email threads by canonical subject (RE:/FW: prefixes removed) and participant lists
- **Hash-based thread ID**: Stable identifier using `canonical_subject + participants + email_count` hash
- **Semantic similarity**: AI analysis to identify the same issue discussed in different contexts
- **Cross-thread analysis**: System examines multiple email files to find repeated mentions
- **Participant diversity**: Issues raised by multiple team members get higher weighting

**Business Rationale**: Issues that persist across multiple communications indicate either:
- **Widespread impact**: Affecting multiple team members or workstreams
- **Escalation attempts**: Issue has been raised multiple times without resolution
- **Team consensus**: Multiple people recognize this as a significant problem

**Executive Value**: Helps Directors identify issues that have "broken through" the normal resolution channels and require their direct intervention.

### UHPAI Aging Threshold

**Business Logic**: Issues older than 5 days automatically qualify as UHPAI (Unresolved High-Priority Action Items)

- **Executive expectation**: Problems should be addressed within one work week
- **Schedule protection**: Prevents small issues from becoming major blockers
- **Leadership visibility**: Ensures Directors see issues that have exceeded normal resolution time

### Scoring Examples

**High-Priority Risk (Score: 4.8)**:
- Role: Director (2.0) - critical stakeholder
- Age: 21 days unresolved (0.8 × 21 = 16.8) - very old issue
- Topic: 0.7 - contains risk keywords
- Repeat: 0.3 (mentioned 3 times: 0.5 × 3 = 1.5, but capped at reasonable levels)
- Total: 2.0 + 16.8 + 0.7 + 0.3 = 19.8

**Medium-Priority Risk (Score: 3.2)**:
- Role: Project Manager (1.5) - delivery responsible
- Age: 1 day unresolved (0.8 × 1 = 0.8) - recent issue
- Topic: 0.7 - contains risk keywords
- Repeat: 0.0 - single mention
- Total: 1.5 + 0.8 + 0.7 + 0.0 = 3.0

**Low-Priority Item (Score: 1.7)**:
- Role: Developer (1.0) - technical implementation
- Age: 2 days unresolved (0.8 × 2 = 1.6) - within normal timeframe
- Topic: 0.0 - no risk keywords
- Repeat: 0.1 (mentioned twice: 0.5 × 2 = 1.0, but minimal)
- Total: 1.0 + 1.6 + 0.0 + 0.1 = 2.7

### Security Considerations in AI Logic

**PII Protection**:
- All email content pre-processed through PII redaction
- AI models never see raw sensitive data
- Redacted placeholders preserve communication context

**Hallucination Prevention**:
- Multi-step validation (Analyzer → Verifier → Composer)
- Evidence-based constraints in prompts
- Confidence scoring for all claims

**Output Sanitization**:
- Final reports reviewed for any remaining sensitive data
- Citations point to redacted sources
- Business-level summaries without technical details
