## Critical Attention Flags

### 1. **UHPAI (Unresolved High-Priority Action Items)**
**Definition**: Questions, decisions, or tasks that have gone unanswered/unaddressed for >5 days

**Business Impact**: These represent stalled progress and potential schedule slippage

**Examples**:
- Unanswered technical questions blocking development
- Pending architectural decisions
- Missing approvals or clarifications
- Escalation points requiring management attention

### 2. **ERB (Emerging Risks/Blockers)**
**Definition**: Potential problems or obstacles identified in communications that lack a clear resolution path

**Business Impact**: These could cause delays, quality issues, or cost overruns

**Examples**:
- Staging environment inconsistencies or anomalies
- Production code bugs affecting user experience
- Technical blockers or dependencies
- Security, payment, or production concerns

## 1. Data Ingestion & Initial Processing

### Approach Overview

**Scalable Email Processing Pipeline**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Raw Email Files] --> B[Header Parsing]
    B --> C[Thread Reconstruction]
    C --> D[Canonical Subject Processing]
    D --> E[Participant Normalization]
    E --> F[Date Standardization]
    F --> G[Content Cleaning]
    G --> H[Structured Email Objects]
```

### Processing Strategy

**Multi-Threaded Email File Processing**:
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple email files in parallel using Python's `concurrent.futures`
- **Memory Management**: Process files in chunks to handle large datasets (1000+ emails)
- **Error Resilience**: Continue processing even if individual emails fail
- **Thread ID Generation**: Use canonical subject + participants + date hash for stable identification

**Scalability Considerations**:
- **Distributed Processing**: Design supports partitioning across multiple workers
- **Incremental Updates**: Only process new/changed files based on timestamps
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable memory limits and processing timeouts
- **Database Storage**: Processed emails stored in JSON format for quick retrieval

### Security & Privacy Integration

**PII Redaction Pipeline**:
- **Pre-processing**: All sensitive data removed before AI analysis
- **Regex-based patterns**: Deterministic, no ML inference required
- **Preserve Context**: Maintain communication structure while protecting privacy
- **Audit Trail**: Complete redaction log for compliance

## 2. The Analytical Engine (Multi-Step AI Logic)

### Multi-Step AI Process Design

**Three-Stage Analysis Pipeline**:

        F1[Risk Prioritization] --> F2[Business Narrative]
        F2 --> F3[Actionable Insights]
    end
```

### AI Model Selection & Justification

**Primary Models**:
- **Analyzer Agent**: `gpt-5-mini` (Cost-effective for pattern recognition)
- **Verifier Agent**: `gpt-5-mini` (Precision-focused validation)
- **Composer Agent**: `gpt-5` (Higher capability for executive communication)

**Embedding Model**: `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` (Open-source, local processing)

**Justification**:
- **Cost Optimization**: Using `gpt-5-mini` for analysis/verification reduces costs by ~70%
- **Capability Matching**: Composer needs higher reasoning for executive-level synthesis
- **Security**: Local embeddings prevent data leakage

- AI models never see raw sensitive data
- Redacted placeholders preserve communication context

**Hallucination Prevention**:
- Multi-step validation (Analyzer → Verifier → Composer)
- Evidence-based constraints in prompts
- Confidence scoring for all claims

**Output Sanitization**:
- Final reports reviewed for any remaining sensitive data
- Citations point to redacted sources
- Business-level summaries without technical details
