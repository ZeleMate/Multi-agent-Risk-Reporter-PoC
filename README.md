# Multi-agent-Risk-Reporter-PoC
This project demonstrates a LangGraph-based multi-agent pipeline designed to transform unstructured documents into structured risk reports.
It integrates classical data ingestion and preprocessing, local vector database storage, and multiple specialized agents for risk detection, validation, sensitive data filtering, and report composition.
The solution is modular, scalable, and designed to be portable across environments, from local PoC setups to cloud-native deployments.
